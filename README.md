# Graph Algorithms Homework

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes graph algorithms using Python's NetworkX library. The focus is on creating a graph to model a real-world network and applying various algorithms to explore its characteristics and find paths.

## Task 1: Graph Creation and Analysis
We modeled a city's transportation network as an undirected graph. The graph was visualized using Matplotlib, and its basic characteristics like vertices, edges, and degrees were analyzed.

## Task 2: Path Finding
Both DFS and BFS were implemented to find paths in the graph. The differences in the paths obtained by each algorithm were compared, and insights into their characteristics and suitability for different scenarios were discussed.

## Task 3: Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm was used to find the shortest path in the graph with weighted edges. The algorithm efficiently found the shortest path between specified vertices.

## Conclusion
The experiments provided valuable insights into how different algorithms perform under various conditions and highlighted the importance of choosing the right algorithm for specific needs based on performance and outcomes.
